# Social Media Links Extra

This is a small custom Drupal module that adds Font Awesome support to the [Social Media Links Block and Field](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_media_links) Drupal module. To use this module, make sure the module has been patched with the [New iconset callback for more flexibility (icon callback)](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_media_links/issues/2728393) patch, and that the [FontAwesome module](https://www.drupal.org/project/fontawesome) has been installed along with the FontAwesome5 library.

Hat tip to Drupal user [sinasalek](https://www.drupal.org/u/sinasalek) for getting this started. I couldn't find a repo to fork, so I just created one.
